 Our visualization illustrates the gold medals based on various dimensions and angles, yet tries
to present a coherent data story. Through winnersâ€™ gender comparison, medal winning trend (for
over 94 years) presentation, and medal count by disciplines exploration, this visualization
provides several insights.
